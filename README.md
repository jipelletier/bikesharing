### Checkout Times by Genders

Analyzing the bike usage by gender comes to show thaat men are more often users than women or unknown. Men are using over three times the number of rides for rides lasting at a 10 min average.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 5pm-6pm seem to be the most popular timeframe for ride usage. 12am-4am seem to be the lowest bike usage time period. The hours before and after working hours seem to be the most popular.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

The usage of bikes by women seem to be lower than that of males but it also remains consistent throughout the day. The high usage by males is driving the busy time trends before and after working hours.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

The trend continues as we see that male subscribers vastly outweigh the female and unknown genders. The male subscribers seem to use the bikes on Thursday and Friday the most. 

### Top Starting Locations

The map details the starting locations with the highest volumes. It appears that the lower half of Mahatten is the hot spot for start times. 

### Top Ending Locations
![Ex7.png](https://github.com/jipelletier/bikesharing/blob/main/Ex7.png)
By looking at the ending locations, we are able to see a similar trend with many of them being in the lower half of Manhatten. Central Park seems to generate traffic which makes sense given that users may like to ride the bikes through the park.
